## Introduction
After seeing the Coding Adventures series by Sebastian Lague on fluid simulation and smoke simulation I was insprired to experiment with this myself. Initially I wanted to make a particle-based fluid simulator, but later settled on making a 3D Eularian smoke simulator. I achieved this by implementing a MAC grid system with a Jacoby pressure solver. The rendering is achieved using a raymarching algorithm that works in the same voxel grid as the pressure solver.
